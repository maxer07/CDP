Hi!
In order to accomplish the task "EPAM employee visualization" was used plugin for Microsoft Excel "Power Map".
To view the results you need to install plug-in that I included in the archive. After successful installation, 
you should:
1) run "cdp_present.xlsx" file in archive;
2) after excel start, go to the "Insert" tab and choose Map -> Lunch GeoFlow.

The archive also has video recording the results of my work.

Thanks.
