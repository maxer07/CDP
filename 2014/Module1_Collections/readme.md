Hi, dear lector and mentor.

Here is my practical task.
Instructions for executing:
1) use commands 'mvn clean' and 'mvn package' to compile this project.
While compiling you could see the result of tests with different types of collection and its timing.
After some deliberation I decided to implement this task with the help of ArrayList (due to result of timing).
2) after these operations you could find executable .jar file in "target" folder, where first argument, which you need to enter is a word to search.
(example "java -jar Task1_Collections-1.0.jar the")
3) after these you will get the result.

Thanks.
