TASK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal is to write a “Hello world ” application, similar to the sample by the link below :
                http://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/spring_hello_world_example.htm
However, you don’t have to use full spring-framework build, only required jars for this. 
Follow the guidelines to complete of the assignment:
I suggest you use Maven to simplify the task.

1.	Please see  the structure of the spring and try to understand which modules are required for you.
2.	Write a correct pom.xml file which will build jar for you and will package you project into zip archive. 
3.	Write a “Hello Spring” application.
4.	The result includes 'hello-spring-sources.zip' and 'hello-spring .jar'.
